## 🎓 Learning Resources

### For Understanding the Code

**Smart Contracts:**

```solidity
// Batch operations save gas
for (uint256 i = 0; i < length; ) {
    // ... process item
    unchecked { ++i; }  // Gas optimization
}
```

**React Hooks:**

```typescript
// Auto-refetch when transaction confirms
useEffect(() => {
  if (isConfirmed) refetchOffers();
}, [isConfirmed]);
```

**QR Code Data:**

```json
{
  "tokenId": "123",
  "eventId": "5",
  "owner": "0x...",
  "signature": "hash" // Tamper detection
}
```
