# Import Errors Fixed ✅

**Date:** October 19, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED

---

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Missing ABI Import in `useTicketNFT.ts` ❌→✅

**Error:**

```
Failed to resolve import "../lib/abis" from "src/hooks/useTicketNFT.ts". Does the file exist?
```

**Root Cause:**

- The newly created `useTicketNFT` hook tried to import from `"../lib/abis"` (non-existent file)
- ABIs are actually in `lib/abi/` directory
- ABIs are already exported from `lib/contracts.ts`

**Fix Applied:**

```typescript
// ❌ Before
import { useReadContract } from "wagmi";
import { TICKET_NFT_ADDRESS } from "../lib/contracts";
import { ticketNFTAbi } from "../lib/abis"; // ❌ Wrong path
import { useMemo } from "react";

// ✅ After
import { useMemo } from "react";
// Removed unused imports - hook returns empty array currently
```

**File Changed:** `src/hooks/useTicketNFT.ts`

**Reason for Removal:**

- The hook currently returns an empty array (waiting for indexer implementation)
- No contract reads are performed yet
- Imports were unused and causing errors
- Clean implementation ready for future enhancement

### 2. `ToastOptions` Type Import Error ❌→✅

**Error:**

```
Uncaught SyntaxError: The requested module '/node_modules/.vite/deps/react-hot-toast.js?v=b1bd1316'
does not provide an export named 'ToastOptions' (at toast.tsx:1:26)
```

**Root Cause:**

- In `react-hot-toast` v2+, types need to be imported separately using TypeScript's `type` import syntax
- Named import of `ToastOptions` alongside regular imports was causing module resolution issues

**Fix Applied:**

```typescript
// ❌ Before
import toast, { Toaster, ToastOptions } from "react-hot-toast";

// ✅ After
import toast, { Toaster } from "react-hot-toast";
import type { ToastOptions } from "react-hot-toast";
```

**File Changed:** `src/lib/toast.tsx`

**Explanation:**

- Separated type import from value imports
- Uses TypeScript's `import type` syntax for type-only imports
- Allows Vite to properly resolve the module in development mode
- Standard pattern for modern TypeScript with ES modules

## Verification

### Dev Server Status: ✅ Running

```
VITE v7.1.9  ready in 297 ms

➜  Local:   http://localhost:5174/
➜  Network: use --host to expose
```

### Compilation Status: ✅ No Errors

- `useTicketNFT.ts`: No TypeScript errors
- `toast.tsx`: No compilation errors (only Fast Refresh warnings for utility file)
- All imports resolve correctly

## Background: Xverse Wallet Warning (Non-Critical)

**Warning Observed:**

```
Failed setting Xverse Stacks default provider. Another wallet may have already set it in an immutable way.
TypeError: Cannot redefine property: StacksProvider
```

**Status:** Non-Critical (Browser Extension Conflict)

**Explanation:**

- This is a browser extension conflict between multiple wallet providers
- Xverse wallet extension tries to set `window.StacksProvider`
- Another wallet extension (possibly Leather or Hiro) has already set it as immutable
- Does not affect the TicketChain application functionality
- The app uses Push Chain wallets, not Stacks wallets

**Impact:** None - this is a harmless browser extension warning

**If Annoying:**
You can:

1. Disable Xverse extension when using the app
2. Use a different browser profile for development
3. Ignore it - it doesn't break anything

## Related Context

### Why `useTicketNFT` Exists

Created as part of **Analytics Dashboard** (Task 7) to track:

- Ticket usage statistics
- Attendance rates
- Scanned vs unscanned tickets

### Current Implementation

- Returns empty array
- TODO: Implement batch fetching or indexer integration
- Placeholder for future on-chain data aggregation

### Import Pattern Reference

Other hooks import ABIs correctly:

```typescript
// ✅ Correct pattern (from lib/contracts.ts)
import { TICKET_NFT_ADDRESS, TicketNFTABI } from "../lib/contracts";
```

Available ABIs in `lib/contracts.ts`:

- `TicketFactoryABI`
- `TicketNFTABI`
- `TicketMarketplaceABI`

All are exported from JSON files in `lib/abi/`:

- `TicketFactory.json`
- `TicketNFT.json`
- `TicketMarketplace.json`

## Summary

✅ **Both import errors resolved**  
✅ **Dev server running successfully**  
✅ **Zero compilation errors**  
✅ **Application ready for development**

**Files Modified:**

1. `src/hooks/useTicketNFT.ts` - Removed incorrect ABI import
2. `src/lib/toast.tsx` - Fixed ToastOptions type import

**No contract changes required** - All fixes were frontend-only.
