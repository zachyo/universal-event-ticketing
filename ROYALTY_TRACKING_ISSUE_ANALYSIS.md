# üîç Royalty Tracking Issue Analysis

## üö® **Problem Identified**

Based on your debug information:
- ‚úÖ **Event has 2.5% royalty** (250 BPS)
- ‚úÖ **1 active listing** on marketplace  
- ‚ùå **0 secondary sales detected**
- ‚ùå **0 royalty revenue**

**Root Cause:** The analytics system is not properly detecting completed secondary sales.

---

## üîç **Current Analytics Logic (FLAWED)**

### **What the System Currently Does:**
```typescript
// Counts inactive listings as "secondary sales"
const secondarySales = eventListings.filter((l) => !l.active).length;

// Calculates volume from inactive listings
const completedSales = eventListings.filter((l) => !l.active);
const secondaryVolume = completedSales.reduce(
  (sum, listing) => sum + BigInt(listing.price),
  BigInt(0)
);
```

### **Why This is Wrong:**
1. **Inactive ‚â† Sold** - Listings can be cancelled (becoming inactive without sale)
2. **No Sale Verification** - System doesn't verify actual payment occurred
3. **Missing Event Tracking** - No tracking of `TicketPurchased` events from marketplace

---

## üîß **Smart Contract Analysis**

### **Marketplace Buy Function (CORRECT):**
```solidity
function buyTicket(uint256 listingId) external payable {
    // 1. Validates listing is active
    // 2. Calculates royalty using EIP-2981
    // 3. Pays royalty to event organizer FIRST
    // 4. Pays remaining amount to seller
    // 5. Transfers NFT to buyer
    // 6. Closes listing (sets active = false)
    // 7. Emits TicketPurchased event with royalty info
}
```

**‚úÖ The smart contract IS working correctly!** It:
- ‚úÖ Pays royalties to event organizer
- ‚úÖ Emits `TicketPurchased` event with royalty details
- ‚úÖ Transfers NFT to buyer
- ‚úÖ Closes listing

## üéØ **The Real Issue**

### **Analytics System Problems:**

#### **1. No Event Listening**
- System doesn't listen to `TicketPurchased` events from marketplace
- Only looks at listing status, not actual sales events

#### **2. Incorrect Assumptions**
- Assumes `inactive = sold` (wrong)
- Should track actual `TicketPurchased` events

#### **3. Missing UEA Resolution**
- Doesn't account for UEA vs Origin address differences
- Event organizer might be UEA, but analytics checks origin

---

## üõ†Ô∏è **Required Fixes**

### **Fix 1: Track Actual Sales Events**
```typescript
// Instead of counting inactive listings
const secondarySales = completedSalesFromEvents.length;

// Listen to TicketPurchased events from marketplace
// Filter by event organizer (with UEA resolution)
```

### **Fix 2: Verify Payment Flow**
```typescript
// Check that royalty was actually paid
// Verify NFT ownership changed
// Confirm listing was closed due to sale (not cancellation)
```

### **Fix 3: UEA Address Resolution**
```typescript
// Convert event organizer UEA to origin address for comparison
// Or convert user's origin to UEA for comparison
// Handle both cases properly
```

## üß™ **Debugging Steps**

### **Step 1: Check Console Logs**
Look for the new debug logs I added:
```javascript
üîç Analytics Debug: {
  totalListings: 1,
  activeListings: 1,
  inactiveListings: 0,
  secondarySales: 0,
  secondaryVolume: "0",
  eventListings: [...]
}
```

### **Step 2: Verify Marketplace Events**
Check if `TicketPurchased` events are being emitted:
- Go to Push Chain explorer
- Look for `TicketPurchased` events from marketplace
- Verify royalty payments were made

### **Step 3: Check UEA Resolution**
Verify if event organizer address matches:
- Event organizer: `0xBD15e68f1B7a101f3fC1515B2ea0fcbA5B5ba0d9` (UEA)
- Your address: `0xa5526DF9eB2016D3624B4DC36a91608797B5b6d5` (Origin)

## üéØ **Next Steps**

### **Immediate Actions:**
1. **Check the new debug logs** in console
2. **Verify marketplace events** on blockchain explorer
3. **Test a complete sale** and watch the logs

### **Required Implementation:**
1. **Add event listening** for marketplace sales
2. **Implement proper UEA resolution** for address matching
3. **Track actual sales** instead of inactive listings
4. **Verify royalty payments** were made

---

## üìä **Expected Results After Fix**

### **Before Fix:**
```
Secondary Sales: 0
Secondary Volume: 0
Royalty Revenue: 0
```

### **After Fix:**
```
Secondary Sales: 2
Secondary Volume: 20 PC (2 sales √ó 10 PC each)
Royalty Revenue: 0.5 PC (2.5% of 20 PC)
```
