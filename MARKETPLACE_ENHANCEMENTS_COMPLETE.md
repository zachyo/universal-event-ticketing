## Technical Notes

### IPFS Gateway

- Using Pinata gateway: `https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/`
- Converts `ipfs://[hash]` to HTTP URL automatically
- Fallback to `/placeholder-event.jpg` on load error

### Performance

- Lazy loading: Metadata only fetched when modal opens
- No unnecessary re-renders
- Modal unmounts when closed (frees memory)

### State Management

- `selectedTicketId`: Tracks which ticket modal to show
- `null` = no modal open
- Number = show modal for that tokenId

### Error Handling

- Image load errors fall back to placeholder
- Loading state shows "Loading ticket details..." message
- Contract read errors handled by wagmi hooks

## Code Quality

### TypeScript

- ✅ Full type safety with TicketMetadata interface
- ✅ Proper typing for contract reads
- ✅ No `any` types used

### Accessibility
