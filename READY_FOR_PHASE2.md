## 🛠️ Implementation Strategy

### Recommended Starting Point: Event Search

**Why start with search?**

- Immediate user value
- No contract changes needed
- Can be built incrementally
- Foundation for other features

**Implementation Steps:**

1. Create SearchBar component
2. Add FilterPanel with date/price/category
3. Implement useEventSearch hook with debouncing
4. Integrate with EventsPage
5. Add URL param persistence

### Alternative: Start with Marketplace

**Why marketplace?**

- High value for power users
- Enables secondary market
- Unlocks offer system

**Implementation Steps:**

1. Update TicketMarketplace.sol contract
2. Add batch operations
3. Implement offer system
4. Build UI components
5. Deploy and test

### Alternative: Start with QR Codes

**Why QR codes?**

- Quick win
- Great for demos
- Mobile-first feature

**Implementation Steps:**

1. Install qrcode.react
2. Create QRDisplay component
3. Add scanner with html5-qrcode
4. Implement verification
5. Mobile optimization

## 📋 Todo List

Phase 2A tasks ready:

```

| User Retention       | >60%       | -       |

## 🚀 Deployment Strategy

### Testnet First

1. Deploy contracts to Push Testnet
2. Test all features thoroughly
3. Fix bugs and optimize
4. Get user feedback

### Mainnet Preparation

1. Security audit (if budget allows)
2. Gas optimization
3. Final testing
4. Deployment checklist

### Feature Flags

- Enable features gradually

- Roll back if needed

## 🎯 Next Action

**Choose your starting point:**

### Option A: Event Search (Recommended)

```bash
cd frontend/ticketchain
mkdir -p src/components/search
mkdir -p src/hooks/search

# Start building SearchBar.tsx
```

### Option B: Enhanced Marketplace

```bash
# Review contract requirements
# Plan data structures
