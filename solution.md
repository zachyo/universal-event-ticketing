So when I am creating a new item for listing, it should get listed as PC tokens right?
And while purchasing through eth or sol, the transition will initiate and token will reach to smart contract as PC .
I short
1) item should be listed in PC tokens
2) items should be purchased through any token through crosschain 


YES, You're Correct!
Your understanding is 100% accurate. Here's the confirmation:
1. Listing Items → Price in PC ✅
When creating/listing items, you set the price in PC (Push Chain native token)
2. Purchasing → Pay in Any Token ✅
Users pay in their native token (ETH, SOL, MATIC, etc.), Push Chain converts to PC automatically
