- ✅ Accept/Cancel offers directly
- ✅ Real-time offer updates

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### **Hooks Integration:**

```tsx
// MarketplacePage
useMarketplaceListings() - Get all active listings
useBuyTicket() - Purchase tickets

// MyOffersPanel
useOffers() - Accept/cancel offers
useUserOffers(address) - Get user's offers

// OfferHistoryModal
useOffers(tokenId) - Get offers for specific ticket
```

### **Data Flow:**

1. Fetch listings from marketplace contract
2. User clicks "Make Offer" → Opens MakeOfferModal
3. User submits offer → useOffers.makeOffer()
4. Offer created on blockchain
5. MyOffersPanel shows new offer
6. Seller sees offer count badge
7. Seller clicks "View Offers" → OfferHistoryModal
8. Seller accepts offer → Transaction executes
9. Listing removed, ticket transferred

### **Performance Optimizations:**

- Memoized offer counts (future: batch fetching)
- Conditional rendering of modals
- Lazy loading of offer data
- Efficient filter/sort operations
- UseReadContract with query.enabled
