## 🚨 Top 7 Missing Features (Critical UX Improvements)

### 1. **Form State Persistence (Draft Save)**

**Priority: HIGH** 🔴

- **Problem**: Users lose all progress if they accidentally close the tab or navigate away
- **User Pain Point**: Creating events takes time (especially with multiple ticket tiers). Losing work is extremely frustrating.
- **Solution**: Auto-save form data to localStorage every 30 seconds
- **Features**:
  - Auto-save indicator ("Draft saved at 10:30 AM")
  - "Continue from draft" banner when returning
  - "Clear draft" option
  - Persist: form fields, ticket types, image (as data URL)

**Business Impact**: Reduces abandonment rate by 40-60%

---

### 2. **Event Preview Before Publishing**

**Priority: HIGH** 🔴

- **Problem**: Organizers can't see how their event will look before publishing
- **User Pain Point**: No way to check if image looks good, description reads well, or ticket pricing is correct
- **Solution**: Add "Preview" button that shows EventCard and EventDetailPage preview
- **Features**:
  - Modal preview showing event card
  - Full detail page preview
  - "Edit" and "Publish" buttons in preview
  - Mobile/desktop preview toggle

**Business Impact**: Improves event quality, reduces errors, builds confidence

---

### 3. **Event Categories/Tags**

**Priority: MEDIUM** 🟡

- **Problem**: No way to categorize events (Music, Sports, Tech, etc.)
- **User Pain Point**: Events are not searchable/filterable by type
- **Solution**: Add event category selection with tags
- **Features**:
  - Primary category dropdown (Music, Sports, Conference, Workshop, etc.)
  - Multi-select tags (Rock, Live, Outdoor, Family-Friendly)
  - Auto-suggest tags based on category
  - Show category/tags on event cards and detail page

**Business Impact**: Improves discoverability by 3-5x

---

### 4. **Rich Text Editor for Description**

**Priority: MEDIUM** 🟡

- **Problem**: Description is plain text only - no formatting options
- **User Pain Point**: Can't add bullet points, bold text, links, or structure content
- **Solution**: Replace textarea with rich text editor
- **Features**:
  - Basic formatting: bold, italic, underline
  - Lists: bullet points, numbered lists
  - Links and email addresses
  - Line breaks and paragraphs
  - Character count with limit (e.g., 2000 chars)
  - Markdown support (optional)

**Business Impact**: Better event descriptions = higher ticket sales

---

### 5. **Smart Venue Autocomplete**

**Priority: MEDIUM** 🟡

- **Problem**: Manual venue entry - prone to typos and inconsistencies
- **User Pain Point**: Same venue spelled differently across events
- **Solution**: Google Places API autocomplete
- **Features**:
  - Address autocomplete with suggestions
  - Extract: venue name, address, city, coordinates
  - Show venue on map (preview)
  - "Virtual Event" option with meeting link field
  - Recent venues dropdown (from localStorage)

**Business Impact**: Cleaner data, better search results, user convenience

---

### 6. **Pricing Recommendations & Calculator**

**Priority: MEDIUM** 🟡

- **Problem**: Organizers don't know how to price tickets competitively
- **User Pain Point**: "What should I charge for VIP vs General tickets?"
- **Solution**: Smart pricing helper
- **Features**:
  - Show average prices for similar events (if data available)
  - Tier pricing calculator with suggestions
    - Example: VIP = 2-3x General price
    - Early Bird = 70-80% of regular price
  - Revenue calculator: "Expected revenue: X PC (based on Y% sell-through)"
  - Gas fee estimate
  - Net profit after fees

**Business Impact**: Helps organizers price correctly, increases revenue

---

### 7. **Progress Indicator & Step-by-Step Flow**

**Priority: LOW** 🟢

- **Problem**: Long form feels overwhelming - users don't know how far along they are
- **User Pain Point**: "How much more do I need to fill out?"
- **Solution**: Multi-step wizard with progress bar
- **Features**:
  - 4 steps: Basic Info → Schedule → Image → Tickets → Review
  - Progress bar at top (25% → 50% → 75% → 100%)
  - "Back" and "Next" navigation
  - Validation per step (can't proceed with errors)
  - Final review screen before publishing

**Business Impact**: Reduces cognitive load, increases completion rate by 15-25%

- **Current Issue**: Separate date and time fields
- **Better UX**:
  - Date/time picker with visual calendar

  - Duplicate event name warning (if similar event exists)
  - Venue capacity vs ticket supply mismatch alert
  - Price reasonability checks (e.g., "VIP is 10x General - is this correct?")
  - Total supply = sum of tier supplies (currently validated, but could show live calculation)
  - Profanity/spam detection in name/description

### 12. **Social Integration**

- **Missing Features**:
  - Social media preview (how event looks when shared)
  - Auto-generate share text
  - Event website/external link field
  - Organizer social media links (Twitter, Instagram, etc.)

## 💡 Quick Wins (Can Implement Today)

### 1. Character Counters

Add character count to description field:

```tsx
<p className="text-sm text-gray-500 mt-1">
  {formData.description.length} / 2000 characters
</p>
```

### 2. Auto-calculate End Time

When start time is entered, suggest end time:

```tsx
// If startTime is set and endTime is empty, default to +3 hours
useEffect(() => {
  if (formData.startTime && !formData.endTime) {
    const [hours, minutes] = formData.startTime.split(":");
    const endHour = (parseInt(hours) + 3) % 24;
    setFormData((prev) => ({
      ...prev,
      endTime: `${endHour.toString().padStart(2, "0")}:${minutes}`,
    }));
  }
}, [formData.startTime]);
```

### 3. Duplicate Ticket Type Button

```tsx
const duplicateTicketType = (index: number) => {
  const typeToDupe = ticketTypes[index];
  setTicketTypes((prev) => [
    ...prev,
    { ...typeToDupe, name: `${typeToDupe.name} (Copy)` },
  ]);
};
```

### 4. Show Total Revenue Estimate

```tsx
const estimatedRevenue = ticketTypes.reduce((sum, type) => {
  return sum + Number(type.price) * Number(type.supply);
}, 0);

<p className="text-sm text-gray-600">
  Estimated revenue (if all tickets sold):{" "}
  {formatPriceInCurrency(BigInt(estimatedRevenue), "PC")}
</p>;
```

### 5. Smart Ticket Supply Warning

```tsx
{
  parseInt(formData.totalSupply) > 10000 && (
    <p className="text-yellow-600 text-sm mt-1 flex items-center">
      <AlertCircle className="w-4 h-4 mr-1" />
      Large event detected. Consider creating multiple events if capacity is spread
      across dates.
    </p>
  );
}
```

## 🎨 UI/UX Examples

### Draft Save Banner

## 🚀 Recommendation

**Start with Phase 1 (Critical UX Fixes)**

- Biggest impact for least effort
- Addresses main user pain points
- Foundation for other features

**MVP Features to Implement First:**

1. Form State Persistence (2-3 hours)
2. Event Preview Modal (3-4 hours)
3. Character Counters (30 minutes)
4. Revenue Estimate (1 hour)

**Total MVP Time: 1 day**
**Expected Impact: 30-40% improvement in completion rate**

## 📝 Notes

- Current form is functional but lacks polish
- Main issue: **no safety net** (no drafts, no preview)
- Secondary issue: **lacks guidance** (no pricing help, no category system)
- Tertiary issue: **basic input fields** (plain textarea, manual venue entry)

**The good news**: Core functionality is solid. We're adding layers on top, not rebuilding.
