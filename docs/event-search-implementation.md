## 📊 Performance Metrics

| Metric          | Target | How to Test               |
| --------------- | ------ | ------------------------- |
| Search Debounce | 300ms  | Type and observe delay    |
| Search Response | <100ms | After debounce completes  |
| Filter Response | <50ms  | Immediate visual feedback |
| History Load    | <10ms  | On search input focus     |

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

### Phase 2A Remaining:

1. **Price Range Filter** - Needs ticket type prices in event data
2. **Category Filter** - Needs category system implementation
3. **Venue Autocomplete** - Extract unique venues for suggestions

### Phase 2B+:

1. **Semantic Search** - AI-powered natural language queries
2. **Saved Searches** - User can save filter combinations
3. **Search Analytics** - Track popular searches
4. **Location-based Search** - Map integration
5. **Advanced Filters** - Organizer reputation, ticket availability %

## 🐛 Known Limitations

1. **Price Filter** - Not fully implemented (needs ticket price data)
2. **Category Filter** - Ready but events don't have categories yet
3. **Search Suggestions** - Currently shows history + hardcoded popular terms
4. **No Backend** - All filtering done client-side (fine for now)

## 💡 Usage Example

```typescript
import { useEventSearch } from "../hooks/useEventSearch";
import { SearchBar } from "../components/search/SearchBar";
import { FilterPanel } from "../components/search/FilterPanel";

function EventsPage() {
  const { events } = useEvents();
  const formattedEvents = events.map(formatEvent);

  const {
    filteredEvents,
    isSearching,
    searchQuery,
    setSearchQuery,
    filters,
    setFilters,
    clearFilters,
    resultCount,
  } = useEventSearch(formattedEvents);

  return (
    <div>
      <FilterPanel
        filters={filters}
        onFiltersChange={setFilters}
        onClearFilters={clearFilters}
      />
      <SearchBar
        value={searchQuery}
        onChange={setSearchQuery}
        isSearching={isSearching}
      />
      <div>{resultCount} events found</div>
      {filteredEvents.map((event) => (
        <EventCard event={event} />
      ))}
    </div>
  );
}
```

## ✅ Next Steps

1. **Test the search functionality** - Try various search queries and filters
2. **Mobile testing** - Verify responsive design works on small screens
3. **Performance testing** - Check with 100+ events
4. **User feedback** - Gather input on usability

Then move to:

- **Marketplace Enhancements** (Batch operations + Offers)
- **QR Code System** (Generation + Verification)
- **Mobile Optimization** (PWA + Touch controls)
