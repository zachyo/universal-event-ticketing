# Push Executor Mapping Fix (October 2025)

## Overview

When users connected with non-Push wallets (e.g., Sepolia MetaMask or Solana Phantom) the **My Tickets** page returned an empty collection even though purchases existed. The frontend queried ticket ownership using the origin wallet address, but TicketChain stores ownership against the Push Chain **Universal Executor Account (UEA)**. This document records the investigation and the corrective actions taken so future regressions can be addressed quickly.

## Symptoms Observed

- **Push Chain (native) login**: Tickets rendered correctly because the wallet returned a Push EOA and the address matched on-chain state.
- **Sepolia login** using the same identity: Ticket list was empty despite confirmed purchases. Console logs showed the origin EOA (`0xa5526D...6d5`) instead of the mapped UEA.
- **Solana login**: UI loaded but showed zero tickets while logging a base58 address (`EQRMqg3N71BT...`) that cannot exist on Push Chain.
- No contract errors appeared because the query simply returned `[]` for unknown owners.

## Root Cause

PushChain SDK exposes both the origin account and its mapped executor. The My Tickets route used `universalAccount?.address` (origin identity) or the wagmi EOA fallback when the universal account was not yet available. Origin addresses are **not** valid Push account identifiers, so contract reads were executed against nonexistent owners.

## Fix Implementation

1. **Resolve the Push executor address before fetching tickets**

   - Imported `usePushChain` from `@pushchain/ui-kit` and invoked `PushChain.utils.account.convertOriginToExecutor(universalAccount, { onlyCompute: true })` to derive the UEA each time the universal account changed.
   - Stored the resolved address in component state and passed it to `useUserTickets`.

2. **Introduce state guards for the mapping lifecycle**

   - Added `isResolvingPushAccount` to block rendering until the executor address is known.
   - Displayed a "Preparing Your Tickets" spinner while mapping runs and a retry prompt if resolution fails (e.g., SDK initialization issues).

3. **Trim legacy fallbacks**

   - Removed the direct EOA fallback that previously considered wagmi’s address equivalent to a UEA, eliminating misleading empty results.

4. **Instrumentation for future diagnostics**
   - Logged both the origin address and the resolved executor address so mismatches are immediately visible in the console during QA sessions.

### Key Files Updated

- `frontend/ticketchain/src/pages/MyTicketsPage.tsx`
  - Executor resolution hook, loading states, retry UI, and ticket query wiring.

## Validation Steps

1. **Sepolia Wallet**

   - Connect through the Push modal with an Ethereum Sepolia wallet.
   - Confirm the console prints both the origin (`eip155:11155111`) address and a Push executor (`0x…`) and that purchased tickets render.

2. **Solana Wallet**

   - Connect a Solana wallet on devnet via the Push modal.
   - Wait for the "Preparing Your Tickets" spinner to disappear and verify the resolved Push executor is logged as a hex address; tickets purchased from Solana now appear.

3. **Native Push Wallet**

   - Connect directly to a Push Chain wallet and confirm the immediate rendering still works (executor equals origin in this case).

4. **Regression Check**
   - Run `npm run lint` inside `frontend/ticketchain` to ensure TypeScript and ESLint pass with the new logic.

## Troubleshooting Tips

- If the spinner never disappears, ensure `PushChain` is available from the SDK. Reconnecting the wallet or reloading the page forces the provider to reinitialize.
- Should the executor resolution throw, inspect network connectivity to the Push RPC endpoint and confirm the connected chain is supported (testnet vs mainnet mismatch can break mapping).
- When working with new chains, call `PushChain.utils.account.convertOriginToExecutor` manually in a REPL with `onlyCompute: false` to verify the UEA exists and is deployed.

## Follow-Up Recommendations

- Extract the executor-resolution flow into a reusable hook (e.g., `usePushExecutorAddress`) so marketplace and validation pages benefit from the same guardrails.
- Consider persisting the resolved executor in local storage to avoid repeated RPC calls during a session, while respecting security requirements.
- Automate an integration test that asserts a Sepolia wallet retrieves the expected ticket count to catch future regressions.
