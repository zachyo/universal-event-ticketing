# QR Code System Implementation

**Date:** October 17, 2025  
**Phase:** 2A - QR Code Generation & Verification

## Overview

Implemented complete QR code system for ticket authentication with generation, scanning, and blockchain verification capabilities.

## Features Implemented

### 1. QR Code Generation (`useQRCode` hook)

**File:** `frontend/ticketchain/src/hooks/useQRCode.ts`

#### Features:

- **Dynamic QR Code Generation** - Creates QR codes with embedded ticket data
- **Data Integrity** - Simple hash signature to prevent tampering
- **High Error Correction** - Level H for better scanning reliability
- **Download Functionality** - Export QR codes as PNG images
- **Expiration Checking** - QR codes expire after 24 hours
- **Format Validation** - Verifies QR code structure and signature

#### Data Structure:

```typescript
interface QRCodeData {
  tokenId: bigint; // NFT token ID
  eventId: bigint; // Event ID
  owner: string; // Owner's wallet address
  contractAddress: string; // TicketNFT contract address
  chainId: number; // 42101 (Push Chain Testnet)
  timestamp: number; // Generation timestamp
}
```

#### Security:

- Simple hash signature: `generateSimpleHash(data)`
- Signature verification on scan
- Timestamp validation (24-hour expiry)
- Prevents QR code replay attacks

**Note:** In production, replace simple hash with proper cryptographic signing (e.g., ECDSA with private key).

### 2. Enhanced QR Code Display Component

**File:** `frontend/ticketchain/src/components/QRCodeDisplay.tsx`

#### Props:

```typescript
{
  tokenId: bigint;
  eventId: bigint;
  owner: string;
  showDownload?: boolean;  // Default: true
  size?: 'sm' | 'md' | 'lg';  // Default: 'md'
  className?: string;
}
```

#### Features:

- **Three Size Options:**

  - Small: 128x128px (w-32)
  - Medium: 192x192px (w-48)
  - Large: 256x256px (w-64)

- **Loading State** - Animated spinner during generation
- **Error Handling** - User-friendly error messages
- **Download Button** - One-click QR code export
- **Info Display** - Shows ticket and event IDs
- **Styling** - White background, gray border, shadow effects

#### Usage Example:

```tsx
<QRCodeDisplay
  tokenId={ticketData.tokenId}
  eventId={ticketData.eventId}
  owner={userAddress}
  size="lg"
  showDownload={true}
/>
```

### 3. QR Code Scanner Component

**File:** `frontend/ticketchain/src/components/QRScanner.tsx`

#### Technology:

- **Library:** html5-qrcode
- **Camera:** Back-facing (environment mode)
- **FPS:** 10 frames per second
- **Scan Box:** 250x250px

#### Features:

- **Auto-start/Stop** - Manual camera controls
- **Real-time Scanning** - Continuous QR code detection
- **Success Feedback** - Green overlay + check icon
- **Error Handling** - Shows camera/scan errors
- **Auto-cleanup** - Properly releases camera on unmount
- **Responsive Design** - Works on mobile and desktop

#### States:

- Idle (camera off)
- Scanning (camera active)
- Success (QR code detected)
- Error (camera/scan failure)

#### Events:

- `onScan(decodedText)` - Called when QR code is successfully scanned
- `onError(error)` - Called on camera or scanning errors

### 4. Organizer Verification Page

**File:** `frontend/ticketchain/src/pages/OrganizerVerificationPage.tsx`

#### Purpose:

Complete ticket verification system for event organizers to validate tickets at entry.

#### Verification Steps:

1. **QR Code Scan** - Decode ticket data
2. **Format Validation** - Verify JSON structure and signature
3. **Blockchain Verification:**
   - Read ticket details from TicketNFT contract
   - Verify current owner matches QR code owner
   - Check if ticket has been used
   - Confirm event ID matches
4. **Display Result** - Show verification outcome with color coding

#### Verification Results:

**✅ Success (Green Border):**

- Owner address matches blockchain
- Ticket is not marked as used
- Event ID matches
- All verifications pass

**⚠️ Warning (Yellow Border):**

- Owner mismatch (ticket may have been transferred)
- QR code still valid but requires manual check

**❌ Error (Red Border):**

- Ticket already used
- Invalid signature
- Expired QR code
- Event ID mismatch
- Invalid format

#### UI Components:

- **Header** - Shows organizer address and instructions
- **Scanner Section** - Camera view with controls
- **Verification Result Card:**
  - Status icon (check/warning/error)
  - Status message
  - Ticket details (ID, event, owner)
  - Verification checklist
  - "Scan Next Ticket" button

#### Data Displayed:

- Ticket ID with # prefix
- Event ID with # prefix
- Full owner address (truncated in some views)
- Owner verification status
- Used ticket status

### 5. Router Integration

**File:** `frontend/ticketchain/src/App.tsx`

Added new route:

```tsx
<Route path="/organizer-scan" element={<OrganizerVerificationPage />} />
```

### 6. Navigation Integration

**File:** `frontend/ticketchain/src/components/Header.tsx`

Added "Scan Tickets" link:

- Only visible when wallet is connected
- Located next to "My Tickets" in navigation
- Directs to `/organizer-scan`

## Libraries Installed

```json
{
  "qrcode": "^1.5.4", // QR code generation
  "@types/qrcode": "^1.5.5", // TypeScript types
  "qrcode.react": "^4.2.0", // React QR code components
  "html5-qrcode": "latest" // QR code scanning
}
```

**Removed:** `react-qr-scanner` (React 19 compatibility issues)

## Integration Points

### Where to Use QRCodeDisplay:

1. **My Tickets Page** - Show QR code for each ticket

   ```tsx
   {
     tickets.map((ticket) => (
       <div key={ticket.tokenId}>
         <TicketCard {...ticket} />
         <QRCodeDisplay
           tokenId={ticket.tokenId}
           eventId={ticket.eventId}
           owner={userAddress!}
         />
       </div>
     ));
   }
   ```

2. **Ticket Detail Modal** - Full-size QR code with download

   ```tsx
   <QRCodeDisplay
     tokenId={selectedTicket.tokenId}
     eventId={selectedTicket.eventId}
     owner={userAddress!}
     size="lg"
     showDownload={true}
   />
   ```

3. **Verification Page** - Display after ticket lookup

### Where Organizers Access Scanner:

1. **Navigation Header** - "Scan Tickets" link (when connected)
2. **Direct URL** - `/organizer-scan`
3. **Event Detail Page** - Could add "Verify Tickets" button for event owners

## Mobile Optimization

## Security Considerations

### Current Implementation:

- Simple hash-based signature
- 24-hour QR code expiration
- Blockchain verification of ownership and status

### Production Recommendations:

1. **Cryptographic Signing:**

   ```typescript
   // Replace generateSimpleHash with ECDSA
   import { ethers } from "ethers";

   const signer = new ethers.Wallet(privateKey);
   const signature = await signer.signMessage(JSON.stringify(data));
   ```

2. **Backend Verification:**

   - Move signature generation to backend API
   - Verify signatures server-side
   - Prevent client-side tampering

3. **Rate Limiting:**

   - Limit QR code generation requests
   - Prevent spam scanning attempts

4. **Audit Trail:**

   - Log all scan attempts
   - Track ticket usage on-chain
   - Create verification history

5. **Token Expiration:**
   - Consider shorter expiration (e.g., event day only)
   - Implement dynamic expiration based on event date

## Known Limitations

1. **Camera Permissions:**

   - User must grant camera access
   - No fallback for denied permissions (yet)

2. **QR Code Expiration:**

   - Fixed 24-hour expiration
   - Should be tied to event date

3. **Offline Scanning:**

   - Requires network connection for blockchain verification
   - No offline mode implemented

4. **Simple Signature:**

   - Not cryptographically secure
   - Should be upgraded for production

5. **No Ticket Marking:**
   - Verification doesn't mark ticket as used
   - Requires separate transaction (future feature)

## Future Enhancements

### Phase 2B Potential Features:

1. **Mark Ticket as Used:**

   ```solidity
   function markTicketUsed(uint256 tokenId) external onlyOrganizer
   ```

2. **Offline Verification:**

   - Cache ticket data
   - Sync when online

3. **Batch Scanning:**

   - Scan multiple tickets quickly
   - Queue verification requests

4. **Analytics Dashboard:**

   - Show scan statistics
   - Entry flow metrics
   - Real-time attendance

5. **Access Control:**

   - Only event organizers can verify
   - Role-based permissions

6. **Multi-Device Sync:**
   - Multiple scanners per event
   - Real-time verification sync
