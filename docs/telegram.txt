Let me clarify how Universal Fee Abstraction (UFA) and Universal Executable Actions (UEA) work with payable functions in Push Chain:
Your Understanding - Mostly Correct!
You're on the right track, but let me refine the details:

How Payable Functions Work Cross-Chain
1. Define Payable Function (Push Chain Contract)

Solidity

// Your contract on Push Chain
contract MyContract {
    // Payable function accepts PC (Push Chain native token)
    function purchaseItem(uint256 itemId) external payable {
        require(msg.value >= 1 ether, "Insufficient payment"); // 1 PC
        // Your logic here
    }
}
2. Universal Fee Abstraction Handles Conversion
You DON'T need to manually convert SOL to ETH or PC! Push Chain's Universal Fee Abstraction does this automatically:

JavaScript

// User pays in SOL (from Solana wallet)
// Push Chain converts it to PC automatically
const tx = await pushChainClient.contract.write(
  contractAddress,
  abi,
  'purchaseItem',
  [itemId],
  { 
    value: ethers.utils.parseEther('1'), // 1 PC equivalent
    // Push Chain handles the conversion from SOL to PC
  }
);

Key Points
What Happens Behind the Scenes:

Solana User Clicks "Pay 1 PC"

Push Chain SDK detects origin chain: Solana
Calculates: 1 PC = X SOL (current exchange rate)

User Approves Transaction in Phantom

User pays X SOL from their Solana wallet
Transaction signed with Solana keypair

Push Chain Relayer Processes

Receives SOL payment
Converts to PC internally
Executes contract function on Push Chain with 1 PC value

Contract Receives Payment

msg.value = 1 PC (always in PC, regardless of origin)
Contract logic executes normally

What You DON'T Need to Do:
❌ Manual currency conversion
❌ Check UEAFactory (unless doing advanced custom logic)
❌ Handle different token standards
❌ Manage exchange rates
❌ Bridge tokens manually
What Push Chain Handles Automatically:
✅ Currency conversion (SOL → PC, ETH → PC, etc.)
✅ Gas fee abstraction
✅ Cross-chain transaction routing
✅ Universal address mapping
✅ Transaction confirmation across chains

Bottom line: Just write normal Solidity payable functions. Push Chain's Universal Fee Abstraction handles ALL cross-chain payment conversions automatically! 🚀
The user experience is seamless - Solana users pay in SOL, Ethereum users pay in ETH, but your contract always receives PC! 💎

thatsssss coooool!!!!!

i will try this and get back to you jack

Hey i already responded on x but @harshr is right, this platform would be a better place to talk about this so that everyone can learn

Common Causes

1. Insufficient Gas or Fee Issues
JavaScript

// Make sure you're providing enough gas for the relayer
const tx = await contract.method({
  gasLimit: 500000, // Increase if needed
  // For Push Chain, ensure fee abstraction is properly configured
});

2. Contract Address Mismatch 
3. Payload Encoding Issues 
JavaScript

// Ensure payload is properly encoded for cross-chain execution
const payload = ethers.utils.defaultAbiCoder.encode(
  ['uint256', 'address', 'bytes'],
  [amount, recipient, data]
);

4. Permission/Authorization Issues 
The executePayload method might require specific permissions


5. Nonce/Replay Protection
JavaScript

// Check if transaction nonce is correct
const nonce = await signer.getTransactionCount();
console.log('Current nonce:', nonce);

This error code suggests custom revert. Check your contract:

Solidity

// Your contract might have:
error InvalidPayload(); // Selector: 0xdc210b1a

function executePayload(bytes calldata payload) external {
    // Add detailed error handling
    require(payload.length > 0, "Empty payload");
    require(msg.sender == relayer, "Unauthorized");
    
    // Decode and validate
    try this._executeInternal(payload) {
        emit PayloadExecuted(payload);
    } catch Error(string memory reason) {
        emit ExecutionFailed(reason);
        revert(reason);
    } catch (bytes memory lowLevelData) {
        emit ExecutionFailedBytes(lowLevelData);
        revert("Execution failed");
    }
}
