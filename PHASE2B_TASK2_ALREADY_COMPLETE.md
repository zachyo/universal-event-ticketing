## 🎊 Another Amazing Discovery!

Upon investigating Phase 2B Task 2 (Marketplace Enhancement with Offers System), I discovered that **all planned features are already fully implemented**!

---

## ✅ What's Already Implemented

### **1. Smart Contract Layer** ✅

The `TicketMarketplace.sol` contract includes:

- ✅ **makeOffer()** - Create offers on listings with optional expiration
- ✅ **acceptOffer()** - Sellers can accept offers
- ✅ **cancelOffer()** - Offerers can cancel their offers
- ✅ **getActiveOffers()** - Retrieve all active offers for a token
- ✅ Offer expiration system with timestamps
- ✅ Automatic offer cleanup on acceptance
- ✅ Value/price validation

---

### **2. Frontend Hooks** ✅

**useOffers Hook** (`hooks/useOffers.ts`)

```typescript
export function useOffers(tokenId?: bigint) {
  // State management
  const [isPreparing, setIsPreparing] = useState(false);

  // Contract interactions
  const makeOffer = async (
    tokenId: bigint,
    offerAmount: string,
    expiresInHours?: number
  ) => {
    const expiresAt = expiresInHours
      ? BigInt(Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000) + expiresInHours * 3600)
      : BigInt(0); // 0 = no expiration

    writeContract({
      functionName: "makeOffer",
      args: [tokenId, expiresAt],
      value: parseEther(offerAmount),
    });
  };

  const acceptOffer = async (offerId: bigint) => { ... };
  const cancelOffer = async (offerId: bigint) => { ... };

  return {
    makeOffer,
    acceptOffer,
    cancelOffer,
    offers,
    isPreparing,
